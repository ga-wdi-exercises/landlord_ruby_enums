# First, Open the data.rb and inspect the data. Identify and write, in comments, the following:
  # Explain how the data is structured
    #The data is stored in a method that creates a hash. "apartments" and "tenants" are arrays containing the respective information.
    #The method then returns a hash with the symbols :apartments and :tenants, which store the values "apartments" and "tenants".
  # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes
    #

# Use enumerables to -
  # Print all the addresses for the apartments
    # apartments.each do |apartment|
    #   puts apartment[:address]
    # end
  # Print all the names for tenants
    # tenants.each do |tenant|
    #   puts tenants[:name]
    # end
  # Print only apartments that are less than 700 in rent
    # less_than_700 = apartments.select do |apartment|
    #    apartment[:monthly_rent] <700
    # end
    # puts less_than_700
  # Print only tenants that are over the age of 44
    # over_44 = tenants.select do |tenant|
    #   tenant[:age] > 44
    # end
    # puts over_44
  # Print only tenants that have an apartment id of 1
    # id_1 = tenants.select do |tenant|
    #   tenant[:apartment_id] == 1
    # end
    # puts id_1
  # Print all the tenants in order from youngest to oldest
    # young_to_old = tenants.sort_by do |tenant|
    #   tenant[:age]
    # end
    # puts young_to_old
  # Print the names of all the tenants alphabetically
    # a_to_z = tenants.sort_by do |tenant|
    #   tenant[:name]
    # end
    # puts a_to_z
  ## More challenging
  # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.
    # tenants.each do |tenant|
    #   apartments.each do |apartment|
    #     if tenant[:apartment_id] == apartment[:id]
    #       puts tenant
    #       puts apartment
    #     end
    #   end
    # end
  # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants
    # apartments.each do |apartment|
    #   all_tenants = tenants.select do |tenant|
    #     tenant[:apartment_id] == apartment[:id]

    #   puts apartment
