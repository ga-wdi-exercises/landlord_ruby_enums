# First, Open the data.rb an inspect the data. Identify and write, in comments, the following:

  # Explain how the data is structured
    #the data is structured into two arrays.  one array for apartments, and one array for tenants.
    #each array is then comprised of many hashes.


  # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes
    #properties for the apartment hashes:
      #id, address, monthly rent, square feet
    #properties for the tenant hashes:
      #id, name, age, apartment id

# # Use enumerables to -
  # Print all the addresses for the apartments
      ruby_apartments = apartments.each do |apartment|
        puts apartment.address
      end
#
#   # Print all the names for tenants
      ruby_tenants = tenants.each do |tenant|
        puts tenant.name
      end
#
#   # Print only apartments that are less then 700 in rent
      cheaper_apartments = ruby_apartments.each do |apartment|
        if(apartment.monthly_rent < 700)
        puts apartment.id
      end
      end



  # Print only tenants that are over the age of 44
    middle_aged = ruby_tenants.each do |tenant|
      if(tenant.age > 44)
        puts tenant.name
      end
    end



  # Print only tenants that have an apartment id of 1
    apartment_one = ruby_tenants.each do |tenant|
      if(tenant.apartment_id == 1)
        puts tenant.name
      end
    end


  # Print all the tenants in order from youngest to oldest
    youngest_to_oldest = ruby_tenants.sort_by do |tenant|
        tenant.age
    end

  # Print the names of all the tenants alphabetically
    alphabet_tenants = ruby_tenants.sort_by do |tenant|
      tenant.name.downcase
    end
      puts alphabet_tenants

  ## More challenging
  # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.
      ruby_tenants.each do |tenant|
      puts tenant.name
        tenant_address = ruby_apartments.find{|apartment| apartment.id == tenant.apartment_id}
      puts tenant_address
    end
    #you do it in this order, instead of setting the block equal to tenant_address, because you need to first have the list of tenant names in order...
    #...to match them to the addresses.


  # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants
    ruby_apartments.each do |apartment|
      puts apartment.address
        occupant = ruby_tenants.find{|tenant| tenant.apartment_id == apartment.id}
      puts occupant
