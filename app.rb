# First, Open the data.rb an inspect the data. Identify and write, in comments, the following:
  # Explain how the data is structured
  # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes
#
# # Use enumerables to -
#   # Print all the addresses for the apartments DONE
#   # Print all the names for tenants DONE
#   # Print only apartments that are less then 700 in rent
#   # Print only tenants that are over the age of 44
#   # Print only tenants that have an apartment id of 1
#   # Print all the tenants in order from youngest to oldest
#   # Print the names of all the tenants alphabetically
#
#   ## More challenging
#   # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.
#   # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants
