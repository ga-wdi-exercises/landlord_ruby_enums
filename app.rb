  # Explain how the data is structured
  # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes

# Use enumerables to -
#   Print all the addresses for the apartments
#   address = apartments.each do |hash|
#     puts hash[:address]
#   end
#   # Print all the names for tenants
# name = tenants.each do |hash|
#   puts hash[:name]
# end
#   # Print only apartments that are less then 700 in rent
# less_than700 = apartments.each do |hash|
#   if(hash[:monthly_rent]<700)
#     p hash[:monthly_rent]
#   end
# end
#
#   # Print only tenants that are over the age of 44
#   tenants_over44 = tenants.each do |hash|
#     if(hash[:age] > 44)
#       p hash[:name]
#     end
#   end
#   # Print only tenants that have an apartment id of 1
#   tenant_id1 = tenants.each do |hash|

#   # Print all the tenants in order from youngest to oldest

# # while index < apartments.length
# #   tenants.each do |hash|
# #     puts data[:age]
# #   index +=1
# # end
# # # p tenants
# # end
# young_to_old = tenants.sort_by do |tenant|

# end

  ## More challenging
  # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.
  # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants
