#   # Print all the names for tenants

#   new_apartments.each do |cheap_ones|
#     if cheap_ones.monthly_rent < 700
#       puts cheap_ones.address
#     end

#   # Print only tenants that are over the age of 44

#   new_tenants.each do |elders|
#     if elders.age > 44
#       puts elders.name
#     end
#   end

  # Print only tenants that have an apartment id of 1

  # first_apartment = new_tenants.select {|id| id.apartment_id === 1}
  # puts first_apartment

  # Print all the tenants in order from youngest to oldest
  # Print the names of all the tenants alphabetically

  ## More challenging
  # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.
  # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants
