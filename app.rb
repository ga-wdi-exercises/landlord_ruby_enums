      #The data in data.rb is called in a method "data" and consists of two hashes (apartments and tenants).
  # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes
      #The keys in apartment are id, address, monthly_rent, square_feet
      #The keys in tenants are id, name, age, and apartment_id
#

#   # Print all the addresses for the apartments

#   # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.
#   # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants
