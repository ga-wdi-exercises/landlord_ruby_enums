# First, Open the data.rb an inspect the data. Identify and write, in comments, the following:
  # Explain how the data is structured
  # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes

  # Data is stored in two variables, each made up of an array of hashes. All apartments have an id, and all tenants have an id AND an apartment_id. Apartments have address, rent, and sq ft properties, and tenants also have name and age properties.

  ## More challenging
  # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.
  # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants
