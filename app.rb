# First, Open the data.rb an inspect the data. Identify and write, in comments, the following:
  # Explain how the data is structured
    ##The date is structed as a def of two arrays; apartments and tennants. Tennants are linked to apartments by :apartment_id
  # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes
    #apartment properties:id, address, monthly_rent, square_feet
    #tennants properties: id, name, age, apartment_id


# Use enumerables to -
  # Print all the addresses for the apartments
  # apt = apartments.each do |apartment|
  #   apartment[:address]
  #   puts apartment[:address]
  # end
  # Print all the names for tenants
  # tenants.each do |tenant|
  #   tenant[:name]
  # end
  # Print only apartments that are less then 700 in rent
  # apartments.each do |apartment|
  #   if apartment[:square_feet] < 700
  #     apartment
  #   end
  # end
  # Print only tenants that are over the age of 44
  # tenants.each do |tenant|
  #   if tenant[:age] > 44
  #     tenant
  #   end
  # end
  # Print only tenants that have an apartment id of 1
  # tenants.each do |tenant|
  #   if tenant[:apartment_id] == 1
  #     tenant
  #   end
  # end
  # Print all the tenants in order from youngest to oldest
  # tenants.sort_by{|tenant| tenant[:age]}

  # Print the names of all the tenants alphabetically
  # puts tenants.sort_by{|tenant| tenant[:name]}


  ## More challenging
  # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.

  # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants


  #App code
