# #   # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes
# #     # apartments - id, address, rent, size
# #     # tenants - id, name, age, which apartment
# #
# # # Use enumerables to -
# #   # Print all the addresses for the apartments

# #
# #   ## More challenging
# #   # When printing tenants also print out the address that the tenant resides in.
# #   # When printing all apartments, under each apartment print all of its tenants
