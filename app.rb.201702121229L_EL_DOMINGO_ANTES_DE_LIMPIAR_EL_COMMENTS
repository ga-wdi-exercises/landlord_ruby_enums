# Part 1 - Practice With Enumerables Read the comments in app.rb to follow the directions practicing enumerables Store the enumerable methods into variables and use puts to verify the results of your methods.
# Part 2 - Build the App
# Comment out any functional code in app.rb, but save it, you can leverage the code from Part 1 to write out parts of this application.
# Bob Pizza is old school and he wants a sick command line interface for this app. Below are Bob's user stories. It is essential that he implement the MVP user stories. The Silver and Gold user stories are considered to be bonuses.
#
# MVP
# - I should have a numbered interface for my application so that I can just type in a number to access different parts of my program.
# - I should be allowed an option to view all the apartments so that I can get an overview of my properties.
# - I should be allowed an option view all the tenants so that I can get an overview of my tenants

# Silver
# - I should be allowed an option to view all the apartments with their tenants so that I can get an overview of Occupancy.
# - I should be able to find where a tenant lives based on tenant name in case of emergencies.

# Gold
# - I should be allowed to remove a tenant from an apartment so that I can track evictions/lease ends
# - I should be allowed to add a tenant to an apartment so that I can track occupancy.
# - I should be allowed to create a new apartment so that I can track new properties in my books
# - I should be allowed to create a new tenant so that I can track new tenants in my books.

# First, Open the data.rb an inspect the data. Identify and write, in comments, the following:
  # Explain how the data is structured
  # DATA SHARES A COMMON KEY,
  # APARTMENTS HAS "id":        {:id=>1}
    # APARTMENTS HAS "id":        {:id=>1, ...
                    # {:id=>1, :address=>"9841 Tanner Key", :monthly_rent=>606, :square_feet=>779},
  # TENANTS HAS "apartment_id"  ... :apartment_id=>8}
                # {:id=>1, :name=>"Ms. Maryse Farrell", :age=>87, :apartment_id=>8},


  # What are the properties for each of the two types of hashes
    # APARTMENTS HAS
    #     :id, :address, :monthly_rent, :square_feet
            # {:id=>1, :address=>"9841 Tanner Key", :monthly_rent=>606, :square_feet=>779},
    # TENANTS HAS
